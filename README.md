# BitGo Express Local Signing Server (REST API)

BitGo Express makes it easy to build multi-signature Bitcoin applications in any language. BitGo Express provides a local REST API interface which handles all client-side operations involving your private keys. This ensures your keys never leave your network, and are not seen by BitGo. 

BitGo Express can also proxy the standard BitGo REST APIs, providing a unified interface to BitGo through a single REST API.
