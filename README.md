BitGo Express

BitGo Express makes it easy to build multi-signature Bitcoin applications in any language. BitGo Express provides a local REST API interface which handles all client-side operations invloving your private keys. This ensures that your keys are managed on your network.

Handling all of your HTTP calls via a local REST interface enables developers to create a request wrapper in any language to sign transactions locally and to communicate with BitGo servers.
